                    <p>The Ford Nucleon was a concept car developed by Ford in 1957, designed as a future
                        nuclear-powered carâ€”one of a handful of such designs during the 1950s and '60s. The concept was
                        only demonstrated as a scale model. The design did not include an internal-combustion engine;
                        rather, the vehicle was to be powered by a small nuclear reactor in the rear of the vehicle,
                        based on the assumption that this would one day be possible by reducing sizes. The car was to
                        use a steam engine powered by uranium fission, similar to those found in nuclear submarines.

                        At the time of the Ford Nucleon's unveiling, nuclear technology was relatively new, and it was
                        believed that nuclear fission technology could be made compact and affordable, such that nuclear
                        fuel would become the primary energy source in the U.S., and gasoline would become obsolete.
                        Ford envisioned a future where gas stations would be replaced with full service recharging
                        stations, and that the vehicle would get 5000 miles before the reactor would have to be
                        exchanged for a new one. These would be scaled-down versions of the nuclear reactors that
                        military submarines used at the time, utilizing uranium as the fissile material. Because the
                        entire reactor would be replaced, Ford hypothesized that the owner would have multiple choices
                        for reactors, such as a fuel-efficient model or a high-performance model, at each reactor
                        change. Ultimately, the reactor would use heat to convert water into steam and the power train
                        would be steam-driven.</p>
