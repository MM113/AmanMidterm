                        <p>HICAS, or HIgh Capacity Actively controlled Steering) is Nissan's rear wheel steering system
                            found on cars ranging from the more recent Skyline and Fairlady Z (300ZX) iterations to
                            smaller models like the Nissan Cefiro (A31), 240SX/Silvia (S13 & S15)/180SX and Nissan
                            Serena/Nissan Largo. It is also found on models from Nissan's Infiniti division, such as the
                            Q45, M45/M35 and G35/G37. Unlike many other four wheel steering systems, HICAS and Super
                            HICAS are fitted to improve handling rather than just as a parking aid.

                            HICAS was introduced on the 1986 (HICAS was almost used on the 1985 model but was not ready
                            in time for production) Skyline GTS coupes (GTS, GTS-R, and GTS-X). The system was later
                            adapted to work on many models in the Nissan range, beginning with the Passage GT.

                            Earlier models of HICAS (hydraulic versions of HICAS) did not depend only on the high speeds
                            using the speedometer but were used to maneuver at lower speeds through obstacles. After
                            disabling HICAS, it has been noted that slow maneuvers including parking and quick response
                            steering seemed more difficult.

                            Earlier HICAS versions used hydraulics to steer the rear wheels. The hydraulic system was
                            powered by the power steering pump and used speed sensors to determine how much and in which
                            direction to steer the rear wheels.

                            Later versions, called Super HICAS, moved to an electric actuator for the rear steering
                            rack, making the system much lighter. The Super HICAS system also used its own computer to
                            control the system instead of speed sensors. HICAS and Super HICAS rear wheel steering.
